## Solenoid RPi GPIO Pins
For reference, in the code I am using the numbers of the GPIO pins, which are different
from the actual, physical pin numbers on the board.

            GPIO            Physical
Grabber:     17                11
Dropper:     27                13
Torpedo:     22                15
Fourth:      23                16

(They make a little L shape on the middle GPIO pin header)
